There are 32 cities in the state. AERB approved QA agencies are located only in 5 major cities like Chennai, Coimbatore, Salem, krishnagiri and Madurai. Most of these cities are in the Northern part of Tamilnadu. Madurai is the only one city that has 2 service agencies in the southern region. Geopy geocoder will help in getting us the latitude and longititude of cities.We can use the Clustering algorithm to group the hospitals(medical instituition) city wise.we can select the most approprite cities where there is no availability of QA services near-by. With foursquare API, the most common venue is selected in the respective cities. Thus the sale price of office space for the agency can be investigated. This project will give an insight to \"Investment cost\" in this new start-up business."
